			I'm selling my 20" iMac G4.  I'm moving and need to sell a few things. I'm a graphic designer, and this machine has served me very well.  It's a great machine in perfect condition.  I'm the only owner (purchased from the apple store online), and I'm selling it with full applecare support.  (Upon purchase I'll transfer the applecare to the buyer.  The applecare continues through May 2007).<br />
			<br />The 20 inch screen is beautiful and in perfect condition (no dead pixels etc.)  The one Gig of ram makes applications on this machine really fly, and the 160 Gig hard drive is plenty of room for pictures, music, movies etc.<br />
			<br />
			Below are some pictures I took this morning:<br />
			<br />
			1. Screenshot of the reformatted machine:<br />

			5. From the side (for whatever that's worth...)<br />
